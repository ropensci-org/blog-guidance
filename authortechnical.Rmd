# Technical Guidelines {#technical}

```{block, type='summaryblock', echo=TRUE}
This chapter explains the technical details of submitting a blog post or tech note (referred to collectively as "posts") for publication on the rOpenSci website - from drafting in an (R) Markdown template, to submitting for review using GitHub Pull Request infrastructure.

We include advice on commonly used elements like adding [an image](#addimage), [a citation](#addcitation), or [embedding a tweet](#addtweet) in case you need them.
```


Briefly, the process is:

1. Get the go-ahead and a tentative publication date from our Community Manager [Stefanie Butland](https://github.com/stefaniebutland).
1. Fork the repository (repo) of the rOpenSci website.
1. Draft your post in R Markdown or Markdown and create or update your author metadata.
1. Preview and refine your post locally.
1. Submit via pull request and preview your post.
1. A blog editor reviews your post.
1. Revise your post in response to review.

This chapter links to templates for posts and checklists that you can also find in the Appendix.

## Fork the repo and create your post folder {#forkcreate}

Fork the rOpenSci website [repository](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2) and create a new branch to work on your post. 
For help with this aspect of git/GitHub, we recommend [happygitwithr](https://happygitwithr.com/fork-and-clone.html) and the [pull request helpers of the usethis package](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/pr-functions.html).

Create a folder `YYYY-MM-DD-slug/` (e.g. `2020-01-20-rorcid/`) under `/content/blog/` or `content/technotes/` for a blog post and a tech note, respectively. 
Your post source and its images should live in `/content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/` or `/content/technotes/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/`.

_In Hugo speak, we'd say your post is a [leaf bundle](https://gohugo.io/content-management/page-bundles/#leaf-bundles)._

## Start the post from a template {#templates}

Prepare your post in your favorite editor in R Markdown **or** Markdown by starting with templates we provide in this book or using blogdown's handy New Post RStudio addin (recommended approach).

Your post source should be either `/content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/index.Rmd` (using R Markdown) or `/content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/index.md` (prepared in Markdown directly).

### Use any template with blogdown's New Post Addin

We recommend this approach because the blogdown New Post Rstudio addin handles the paths for you.
If you don't use RStudio you can still use the addin, but in e.g. Ubuntu the new post will first get opened in Vim.

* Install `whoami` and `blogdown`

```r
whoami_path <- try(find.package("whoami"), silent = TRUE)

if (is(whoami_path, "try-error")) {
  install.packages("whoami")
}

remotes::install_github("rstudio/blogdown")
```

* Install Hugo if it wasn't already installed on your machine.

```r
blogdown::install_hugo()
```

* Re-start R.

* For your local roweb2 copy, after creating a branch, run blogdown's New Post addin from the RStudio addins menu or `blogdown:::new_post_addin()`

  * Enter a title, no need to worry about title case at this stage.
  * Enter your name if `whoami` wasn't able to guess it.
  * Choose the correct date.
  * Choose "blog" or "technotes" as a subdirectory.
  * Choose an archetype, Rmd or md.
  * Also choose the correct extension: .Rmd if Rmd, Markdown (.md) if md.
  * Select any relevant tag. To create new tags, wait until the post draft is open.

### Get R Markdown template

[R Markdown template](#templatermd) is to be saved as `/content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/index.Rmd`.

It will need to be knit (e.g. RStudio knit button). Add both `index.Rmd` and `index.md`to your PR.

### Get Markdown template

[Markdown template](#templatemd) is to be saved as `/content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/index.md`.

## Walkthrough with code snippets {#usetemplates}

### What goes in YAML {#whatgoesinyaml}

This is the YAML from our [post template](#templatermd), with comments to explain some components:

```{r posttemplate, results="asis"}
show_template("https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/raw/master/archetypes/md/index.md", 
              lang = "yaml",
              yaml_only = TRUE)
```

#### Add subject tags

Add tags to the YAML of your post to make it more findable. Browse [our page that lists all tags in use](https://ropensci.org/tags/) and re-use an existing tag rather than creating a new one e.g. 'packages' exists, so use that, rather than 'package'.

For a post about your peer-reviewed package, use 'Software Peer Review', 'R', 'community', 'packages', the package name, tags that were [topic labels](https://github.com/ropensci/software-review/labels) in your package review such as 'data-access', and any others you see fit.

#### Optional Twitter cards metadata

If you're curious about the `description`, `twitterImg` YAML fields in the post metadata and how they can help draw readers to your post, refer to [our explanation of Twitter cards](#twittercards).

Delete `description` and `twitterImg` YAML fields if you don't use them. 

### Examples

Comparing the raw Markdown to the live posts in these examples might be helpful.

- A blog post about a package that has passed software peer review.
Compare [raw markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/roweb2/master/content/blog/2019-10-21-rmangal.md) with the [live post](https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/10/21/rmangal/).

- A tech note.
Compare [raw markdown](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ropensci/roweb2/master/content/technotes/2018-10-06-av-release.md) with the [live tech note](https://ropensci.org/technotes/2018/10/06/av-release/).

### To add an image {#addimage}

If your blog post has any images that are **not** generated from R Markdown, put them in the same folder as your post source (`/content/blog/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/` or `/content/technotes/YYYY-MM-DD-slug/`).
To reference them in your post, use `name-of-image.png`. 

- Insert an image `{{< figure src = "name-of-image.png" width = "200" alt = "this is the alternative text" >}}`

- Insert the same image, but centered and bigger. Notice ` width` and `class`. `{{< figure src = "name-of-image.png" width = "400" alt = "this is the alternative text" class = "center" >}}`

- To insert the image aligned to the right, use `class = "pull-right"`

- To hyperlink an image, use the `link` option of the [Hugo `figure` shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#use-hugos-built-in-shortcodes).

- In R Markdown, shortcodes need to be html escaped, refer to [the template](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/archetypes/Rmd/index.md) for an example.

If you want to **generate** images from R Markdown use [our R Markdown template](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/archetypes/Rmd/index.md) in order not to worry about paths.

Every image should be accompanied by alternative text (`alt="some text"`) to make it more accessible to people with disabilities and provide a better user experience for everyone.
The alternative text should convey the meaning or content that is displayed in the image.
Refer [to this tutorial for details on what should go in alternative text](https://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/informative/).

### To add a citation {#addcitation}

To add citations, refer to them in the body of your post:
```
Citation of the primary literature[^1].
Citation of an R package[^2].
Citation of a website[^3].
```

And list your sources at the bottom of your post:

```
[^1]: Sciaini, M., Fritsch, M., Scherer, C., & Simpkins, C. E. (2018). NLMR and landscapetools: An integrated environment for simulating and modifying neutral landscape models in R. Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 9(11), 2240-2248. <https://doi.org/10.1111/2041-210X.13076>
[^2]: Elin Waring, Michael Quinn, Amelia McNamara, Eduardo Arino de la Rubia, Hao Zhu and Shannon Ellis (2019). skimr: Compact and Flexible Summaries of Data. R package version 2.0.2. https://CRAN.R-project.org/package=skimr
[^3]: Hugo static site generator. https://gohugo.io/
```

#### How to find citation text for a package or article

To get the citation for an R package, run `citation("packagename")`.

To get the citation for an article, you can use the RStudio Addin for [rcrossref](https://docs.ropensci.org/rcrossref/), or get the citation from a paper's DOI by running e.g.

```
rcrossref::cr_cn("10.1111/2041-210X.13076", format="text", style="apa")

[1] "Sciaini, M., Fritsch, M., Scherer, C., & Simpkins, C. E. (2018). NLMRandlandscapetools: An integrated environment for simulating and modifying neutral landscape models inR. Methods in Ecology and Evolution, 9(11), 2240–2248. doi:10.1111/2041-210x.13076"
```

To get the citation for an article in [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com/), find the article, click the quote symbol (in search results under the article) to open the "Cite" window, and copy the APA style text.


```{r citation, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Get a citation from Google Scholar."}
knitr::include_graphics("images/citation-gscholar.png")
```

### To embed a tweet {#addtweet}

Use a [Hugo shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#tweet) to embed a tweet using its ID e.g. `{{< tweet 1138216112808529920 >}}`. In R Markdown, shortcodes need to be html escaped, refer to [the template](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/archetypes/Rmd/index.md) for an example.

## Style Guide {#styleguide}

- For formatting of package names, functions, and code, follow the [tidyverse style guidance](https://style.tidyverse.org/documentation.html#r-code). Format package names as regular text.
- When linking to [rOpenSci packages](https://ropensci.org/packages/) use their docs.ropensci.org URL, e.g. https://docs.ropensci.org/drake/
- Use ### or #### to format headings in your post; larger sizes don't look good. Note long headings with #### don't currently wrap well.
- Use title case for the title of your post; use sentence case for headings inside the post.
- 'rOpenSci' not 'ROpenSci'
- When adding links to your post, use relative instead of absolute URLs e.g. `/blog/` instead of `https://ropensci.org/blog/`.
- Use [Hugo shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#use-hugos-built-in-shortcodes) (not html) to add images, tweets, gists etc. 
- In R Markdown wrap Hugo shortcodes between html preserve tags as shown in the [template](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/archetypes/Rmd/index.md).
- Instead of using html widgets (`DT`, `leaflet`, etc.), include a screenshot and use the `link` option of the [Hugo `figure` shortcode](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#use-hugos-built-in-shortcodes) to direct readers to an online version of the widget.
- Use informative [alternative text](#addimage) for all images.
- Add new line at end of each sentence ([makes diffs easier to interpret and easier for editor to suggest specific changes](https://cirosantilli.com/markdown-style-guide#line-wrapping)).

## Create or update your author file {#createauthorfile}

### Why?
The rOpenSci website has a page listing [all authors](https://ropensci.org/author/) who have contributed to a blog post, tech note, or presented in a Community Call.
A click on your by-line in a post takes the reader to your author page that has links to your online home, possibly your Twitter or GitHub profile(s), and a list of all the content you’ve authored on our site.
For staff and leadership team members, editors for software peer review, or members of our Code of Conduct Committee, their rOpenSci title is also listed on their author page.


### How?
If you don't already have an author page, create a folder called `yourfirstname-yourlastname` in your local copy of [`roweb2/content/author/`](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/tree/master/content/author).
You can have accents, middle initials, or hyphens appear in your name if you name your folder appropriately. That can be tricky so we have examples below.

In that folder, create a file called `_index.md` with information about your online presence.
You can copy this template below (or get it via [roblog](https://docs.ropensci.org/roblog/reference/blog-posts.html) after installing it via `install.packages("roblog", repos = "https://dev.ropensci.org")`):

```{r authorfiletemplate1, results="asis"}
show_template("author-file-template.md", 
              lang = "yaml",
              details = TRUE
)
```

At minimum, provide your name and a link or your Twitter, GitHub, or GitLab username.
Add your usernames or ID's without the "@" or the "https:..."). The link field can be your personal website URL, for example.

### Examples 

This author file, [`/author/kelly-obriant/_index.md`](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/content/author/kelly-obriant/_index.md) 

```yaml
---
name: Kelly O'Briant
link: https://kellobri.github.io/
twitter: kellrstats
github: kellobri
---
```

... generates [Kelly O'Briant's author page](https://ropensci.org/author/kelly-obriant/)

```{r authorpage, fig.cap ="Screenshot of Kelly O'Briant's author page"}
webshot2::webshot("https://ropensci.org/author/kelly-obriant/",
                  selector = "section.author",
                  expand = c(50, # top
                             0, # right
                             0, # bottom
                             0 #left
                             )
                  )
```


This author file, [`/author/maëlle-salmon/_index.md'](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/content/author/ma%C3%ABlle-salmon/_index.md)

```yaml
---
name: Maëlle Salmon
twitter: ma_salmon
bio: rOpenSci Research Software Engineer, Associate editor of rOpenSci Software Peer Review
github: maelle
gitlab: maelle
keybase: maelle_salmon
orcid: 0000-0002-2815-0399
---
```

... generates [Maëlle Salmon's author page](https://ropensci.org/author/ma%C3%ABlle-salmon/).

For an example of how to name the folder with an accent and initials, see this [author file](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/content/author/rich%C3%A8l-j.c.-bilderbeek/_index.md) that generates [Richèl J.C. Bilderbeek's author page](https://ropensci.org/author/rich%C3%A8l-j.c.-bilderbeek/).
The folder name must include accents, initials with periods, and hyphens for spaces, in order to link to their blog content.

Look at [other people's folder names](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/tree/master/content/author) for examples. 

## Pre-submission checks {#presubchecks}

You can use functions in the [roblog package to do some automated checks](https://docs.ropensci.org/roblog/articles/checks-guidance.html) on your post. 

- `ro_lint_md()` to check and enforce use of complete alternative descriptions for image, of relative links to rOpenSci website, of [Hugo shortcodes](https://gohugo.io/content-management/shortcodes/#use-hugos-built-in-shortcodes) for tweets, of lower camelCase for rOpenSci name
- `ro_check_urls()` to check for URLs that might be broken 

In the first comment of your pull request submitting a post, please copy-paste the checklist corresponding to your post (hover, a copy-paste button will appear at the top-right corner of the shaded area) and check off items.

### Checklist for a post about a peer-reviewed package

```{r checklistpkg, echo = FALSE}
show_checklist(c("submission-checklist.csv", "submission-checklist-peer-reviewed-pkg.csv"))
```

### Checklist for any other post

```{r checklistother, echo = FALSE}
show_checklist("submission-checklist.csv")
```

## Submit your draft post {#submitpost}
Once you've drafted your blog post, you can [preview locally using Hugo](#localpreview) (recommended) or skip to the next step to make a pull request and preview that.

### Local preview with Hugo {#localpreview}

If you wish to preview your post locally, as it will appear in our site, you must install Hugo.
To install, refer to [Hugo docs](https://gohugo.io/getting-started/installing/) or run `blogdown::install_hugo()`.

Then run `hugo serve` in the repo directory to start a local server on http://localhost:1313. 

The version of Hugo used by the rOpenSci web server is defined in [netlify.toml](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/netlify.toml).

When this preview looks good to you, you should submit your post as a pull request.

### Make a pull request

If using the R Markdown template, knitting `index.Rmd` will generate both `index.md` and `index.html`.
`index.html` will be ignored; do commit both `index.Rmd` and `index.md`.

* Open a [**draft** pull request (PR)](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/about-pull-requests#draft-pull-requests) from your fork ([using the web interface](https://help.github.com/en/github/collaborating-with-issues-and-pull-requests/creating-a-pull-request-from-a-fork), see step 8 for creating a **draft**), or [`usethis::pr_push()`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/articles/articles/pr-functions.html#submit-pull-request) that will save you some work and that will in the end open the same web interface where you can choose Draft PR in the last step)

* Mark the draft PR as ready for review at least one week prior to the planned publication date. A review from blog editor(s) will be automatically requested by GitHub.

* If you opened a PR instead of a **draft** PR, the PR can't go back to a draft stage but no problem, only make sure to add a comment to the PR mentioning `@ropensci/blog-editors` once to tell them the PR isn't ready for review, and another comment later (again mentioning `@ropensci/blog-editors`) to tell them the PR is really ready for review.

From the PR, Netlify will start building the new version of the site within seconds and you can preview your changes to make sure everything looks as intended.
Otherwise push additional fixes till things look right.
