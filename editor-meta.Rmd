# Editorial Governance {#editormeta}

```{block, type='summaryblock', echo=TRUE}
This chapter explains management of the blog editors GitHub team and the process for staff-authored posts.
```

## GitHub team

rOpenSci blog editors are the member of the [`@ropensci/blog-editors`](https://github.com/orgs/ropensci/teams/blog-editors) team.

* Blog editors can be tagged in [any ropensci repo](https://github.com/ropensci/), in particular [roweb3](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb3/), by writing `@ropensci/blog-editors` (e.g. `:wave: @ropensci/blog-editors, I have trouble adding citations in my post!`).

* Blog editors have write access to the roweb3 repo.

For adding a new blog editor, the team maintainer or any ropensci admin

* ensures the user has [enabled 2FA](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa),

* [adds them to the team](https://github.com/orgs/ropensci/teams/blog-editors/members) as Member (the default role).

The blog editors can filter their notifications, e.g. using the [`reason:team-mention` filter](https://github.com/notifications/beta?query=reason%3Ateam-mention).

The blog editors don't necessarily have write access to the blog-guidance repo but are encouraged to make PRs.

## Posts authored by staff

* Staff members can bypass review for tech notes but they can choose to request a review by blog editors.
* Staff members' blog posts should be scheduled together with the Community Manager.
* Staff members are responsible for promoting their own posts from their personal account on Mastodon and/or LinkedIn tagging rOpenSci's accounts.
