# Editorial governance {#editormeta}

## GitHub team

rOpenSci blog editors are the member of the [`@ropensci/blog-editors`](https://github.com/orgs/ropensci/teams/blog-editors) team.

The team is maintained by [`@stefaniebutland`](https://github.com/stefaniebutland) at the moment.

* Blog editors can be tagged in [any ropensci repo](https://github.com/ropensci/), in particular [roweb2](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/), by writing `@ropensci/blog-editors` (e.g. `:wave: @ropensci/blog-editors, I have trouble adding citations in my post!`).

* Blog editors have write access to the roweb2 repo.

* Blog editors are ["code owners"](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/.github/CODEOWNERS) of `roweb2/content/technotes`, `roweb2/content/blog`, `roweb2/content/commcalls` according to [roweb2's CODEOWNERS file ](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/blob/master/.github/CODEOWNERS) so any PR touching a file under these paths will automatically request their review. When one of them posts a review, it will be marked as ["on behalf of `@ropensci/blog-editors`"](https://github.com/ropensci/roweb2/pull/619#issuecomment-589680666).

For adding a new blog editor, the team maintainer or any ropensci admin

* ensures the user has [enabled 2FA](https://help.github.com/en/github/authenticating-to-github/securing-your-account-with-two-factor-authentication-2fa),

* [adds them to the team](https://github.com/orgs/ropensci/teams/blog-editors/members) as Member (the default role).

The blog editors can filter their notifications, e.g. using the [`reason:team-mention` filter](https://github.com/notifications/beta?query=reason%3Ateam-mention).

The blog editors don't necessarily have write access to the blog-guidance repo but are encouraged to make PRs.

## Posts authored by staff

* Staff members can bypass review for tech notes but they can choose to request a review by blog editors.
* Staff members' blog posts should be scheduled together with Stefanie Butland.
* Staff members are responsible for creating the [discussion forum entry](#publish) for their own post and must [tweet from the rOpenSci Twitter account](#tweetpromo) (directly or via the Tweetdeck rOpenSci team) before tweeting from their personal account.
