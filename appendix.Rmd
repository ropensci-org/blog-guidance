# Understanding Twitter cards {#twittercards}

A [Twitter card](https://developer.twitter.com/en/docs/tweets/optimize-with-cards/overview/abouts-cards) means than when a URL is included in a tweet, what other Twitter users see is not the URL but instead a "card", i.e. the metadata from the URL rendered in a nice preview.
The Twitter metadata in a [post's YAML](whatgoesinyaml) helps it "look good" when an account like R Weekly Live or other readers link to the post in a tweet. 
The relevant YAML tags for rOpenSci posts are `title`, `description`, `twitterImg`, `twitterAlt`.
These same metadata tags might be picked up by other platforms such as Slack.

If a specific `description` is not specified, the first sentences of the post (~100 characters) are used.
If a specific `twitterImg` is not specified, a thumbnail of the rOpenSci logo is used. 
If you use `twitterImg` also use `twitterAlt` to provide alternative text for screenreader users.

This is what a tweet about an rOpenSci post looks like by default.

```{r twitter_default, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Example of tweet without twitterImg specified"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/twitterImg_default.png")
```

This is what a tweet about an rOpenSci post looks like with YAML `twitterImg` specified.

```{r twitterImg, echo = FALSE, fig.cap = "Example of tweet with twitterImg specified"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/twitterImg.png")
```

If you specify a `twitterImg`, ensure that its dimensions are appropriate. 
(Search for those in a search engine for current recommendation.) 
These may be different from the dimensions of an image featured in your post. 
You could save a separate copy of an image for the purpose of `twitterImg` only if you think it will draw people to read your post.

How do you know what it will look like?
You can check the Twitter metadata by pasting a post's preview link in the [Twitter card validator](https://cards-dev.twitter.com/validator). 
You might have to click the validator twice.
